DESCRIPTION:
====================================

    The CGPOP miniapp models the conjugate gradient solver in the Parallel
    Ocean Program (POP 2.0) (http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/POP/).  There are
    several different implementations of the miniapp included in this package:
    
        - caf1D     Co-Array Fortran version using 1D data structure for
                    communication.

        - caf1D_sync_iamges

                    Co-Array Fortran version using 1D data structure for
                    communication.  This version overlaps computation and 
                    communication.

        - caf2D     Co-Array Fortran version using 2D data structure for
                    communication.

        - mpi1s1D   MPI version using 1-sided (put/get) communication and 1D
                    data structure.

        - mpi2s1D_overlap
                    
                    MPI version using 1-sided (put/get) communication and
                    1D data structure.  This version overlaps computation and
                    communication.

        - mpi2s1D   MPI version using 2-sided (send/recv) communication and 1D
                    data structure.

        - mpi2s2D   MPI version using 2-sided (send/recv) communication and 2D
                    data structure.

Installation and Usage Instructions
====================================

    See the technical report (cgpop-v1.0-tech-report.pdf) included in the 
    doc/ subdirectory.


====================================
DOCUMENTATION:
====================================

    CGPOP is commented so that it can generate Doxygen
    (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) documentation files.  Under each of
    the included implementations there is a '/doc/' directory that includes
    this documentation.  To view this documentation in a web-broser simply view
    the '/doc/index.html' file for the version you are interested in.  If you
    have doxygen installed, the documentation can be regenerated by running the
    'doxygen' command within a given implementation's directory.
